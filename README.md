- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brucenorton
- It has been months, even years since I have contributed to GitHub.
- I'm still developing, just got out of the hubbing habit.
- "What, no version contol?" you say.
- Well no, but mostly working on teaching & learning resources... and, well no excuse.

I will say 12 Hail Linus Torvalds and 3 Our Berner-Lees.
